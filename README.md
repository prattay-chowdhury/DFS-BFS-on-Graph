# DFS-BFS-on-Graph

What does the program do?
1. The program will build a undirected, disconneted graph with 15 vertices and 25 edges using adjacency matrix. There are two disconneted parts in the graph.
2. It will individually show vertices and edges of the graph. 
3. Then the program will print the vertices in DFS and BFS order respectively. The traversal starts from a given vertex (index 0 in this case) and keep on traversing untill all the vertices are visited (including disconnected parts).The program is independent of the number of disconnected parts in the graph.
4. Please note that in this program, the value of vertices are from 0 to 14. While the index of the vertices are also from 0 to 14. All the numbers printed out are the value of vertices.
